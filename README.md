## About
As a newcomer to the DFW area, I wanted to familiarize myself with the interesting sites in this amazing city. So this is my way of doing it...
This DFW-Tour is developed in Basic HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery and KnockoutJS framework. Google Maps and FourSquare API's  were consumed to give information. KnockoutJS brings an MVVM flavour to the design. 


# Javascript Files
- `lib`
    - `knockout-3.4.2.js` (Knockout framework)
- `main.js` (Main application file)
- `mapStyles.js` (Contains the styles for the custom Google Maps look)
- `model.js` (Contains myLocations to populate the map)


## APIs
